# POMMES-EU
This repository presents running code and input data for a European electricity and hydrogen model. It uses a specific version of [POMMES](https://github.com/qraillard/pommes-milp), an open source framework to model investment pathways in multi-energy systems.

The framework enables to minimise the system costs to meet the energy services demand by modelling the investment
and operating costs of energy conversion, storage and transport technologies.
